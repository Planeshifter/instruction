						<p>In relation to any experiment we may speak of this hypothesis as the "null hypothesis," and it should be noted that the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only in order to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis.</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Often when working with data, you might notice some pattern and observe an effect. The question which then
					arises is whether this effect has arisen purely by chance or reflects some true property of the underlying
					population. For example, consider the following scenario: Consuming a new weight loss drink for a period of two weeks has resulted
					in an average decrease of body weight of 3 lbs among 30 particicpants. Hypothesis testing can help us to assess whether
					such an observed effect is <i>significant</i>, i.e. whether it is unlikely that the effect is a product of chance.
					The logic of hypothesis testing is similar to a mathematical proof by contradiction. To prove a statement by contradiction, you assume
					temporarily that the statement is wrong. If this leads to a contraditction, you can then conclude that the statement must actually be true.
					Hypothesis testing proceeds similarly, although it does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions. To test whether a certain effect exists, we
					assume that it does not exist. This is the null hypothesis. It is denoted as H0. The alternative hypothesis, which corresponds
					to the existence of an effect, is denoted as H1.
					Whatever conclusion we reach from a test, we cannot be certain that we made the right decision. Depending on which hypothesis is true, there are two types of error we could have made:
					<table style="text-align:left">
						<caption>Results of Hypothesis Test</caption>
						<tr>
							<th>Truth \ Decision</th>
							<th>Fail to reject H0</th>
							<th>Reject H0</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>H0</td>
							<td>Correct</td>
							<td>Type 1 error</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>H1</td	>
							<td>Type 2 error</td>
							<td>Correct</td>
						</tr>
					</table>


				</p>
				<p>
					To carry out an hypothesis test, the following steps are generally required:
					<ol>
						<li>A specific probability model for the data is assumed</li>
						<li>The observed data is summarized into a test statistic with a known distribution under H0. The distribution of the test statistic lets us assess how unexpected the observed data are.</li>
						<li>For a given significance level α, we obtain a critical value from the distribution of the test statistic. If the observed test statistic exceeds this value in magnitude, the null hypothesis is rejected.	</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p> Let us now consider one of the simplest hypothesis testing scenarios, in which one would like to test whether an effect exists, i.e. whether the location parameter of a distribution is larger than zero.</p>
				<h3>One-Sided Location Test</h3>
				<p>The basic assumption for the z-Test to be applicable is that the data are drawn from a normal distribution with some mean μ and standard deviation σ:</p>
				<div class="display" id="eqData"></div>
				<p>Let's start by considering a situation in which you want to detect a positive effect. As described previously, you
				will then choose the null hypothesis to cover the case of no or a negative effect, so that we have:</p>
				<div class="display" id="eqHypo"></div>
				<p>For the described situation, you can think of μ<sub>0</sub> as being equal to zero in the equation. However, there might be other scenarios where you might want to test whether the parameter exceeds a certain
					threshold: For example, an environmental agency might need to assess whether the average emissions of a car exceed the allowed maximum or not.</p>
				<p>The test statistic used for the z-Test is:</p>
				<p class="display" id="eq1"></p>
				<p id="example">
					At a significance level of <span data-var="alpha" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0.01" data-max="0.5" data-step="0.005"></span>, the critical value, i.e. the value above which the null hypothesis is rejected, is equal to <b><span data-var="critical"></span></b>.
					The resulting rejection region for the <span data-var="type"></span> location test is displayed as the shaded region in the following plot.
				</p>
				<div id="quiz01"></div>
				<div id="plot1" class="fb" style="width:50%"></div>
				<p>
				Let us consider the following example:
				<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
				<span class="marginnote">
				Worked Example
				</span>
				A randomized control trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug. For a sample of N = 400 patients, the average
				effect was x&#772; = 0.3. It is assumed that the data are drawn from a normal distribution with known standard deviation σ = 2. We wish to test whether there is
				a positive effect of the drug at a significance level of α = 0.01.
				<ol>
					<li>For the given α, we find a critical value of z = 2.33.</li>
					<li>The observed test statistic is
						<div class="display" id="eqZobs"></div>
					</li>
					<li>Since z<sub>obs</sub> > z, we reject the null hypothesis at α = 0.01 and conclude that there is sufficient evidence that the new drug is effective</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					In this test, the probability of having obtained a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Concluding that an effect is real when there is actually none">false positive</a> is α = 0.01.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Two-Sided Location Test</h2>
				<p>You should consider using a two-sided hypothesis test whenever you are not interested in a directional effect,
				but whether there is any effect at all. The hypotheses to be tested are now</p>
				<div class="display" id="eqHypo2"></div>
				<p id="example2">
					At a significance level of <span data-var="alpha" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0.01" data-max="0.5" data-step="0.005"></span>, the upper critical value is <b><span data-var="critical"></span></b> and the lower one <b>-<span data-var="critical"></span></b>.
					The resulting rejection region for the <span data-var="type"></span> two-sided location test is displayed as the shaded region in the following plot.
